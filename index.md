# About Ho'ohui
Our goal is to create a better way to connect students to job opportunities. This can be from internships to potential job openings, we are striving to inform graduating students about various companies that are hiring within the year in order to give these students a chance at starting their career after college. We also want to include the hiring companies to interact with the students by hvaing them make their own account and choose from the listed users.

## Installation

Step 1: Install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Step 2: [Download a copy of Ho'ohui](https://github.com/ho-ohui/hoohui).

Step 3: cd into the app directory install the required libraries with:

## Application Design
### Data model
The ho'ohui data model is implemented by two javascript classes: StudentProfile and Position. Both of them encapsulate a MongoDB collection with the same name and export a single variable that provides access to that collection.

## UHM Student's First Impressions
### Tyler Eguchi
"I feel that this is a great way to connect employers to the local community."
:star::star::star::star:

### Kobe Dait
"If this project was became an actual website for local people to use, I think this would be a potential competitor compared to other job finding websites."
:star::star::star:

### Matthew Spencer
"As a business major I'm always competing against other people, with this further developed it'll be easier for me to show my skills to various employers." 
:star::star::star::star:

### Kyle Fujita
"This is pretty good 10/10 I would use this again."
:star::star::star::star::star:

### Kyle Nuesca
"I see potential in this project, I believe that it would often be used in Hawaii, due to the constant search for jobs."
